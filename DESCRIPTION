Description: An implementation of generalized linear models (GLMs) for studying relationships among attributes in connected populations, where responses of connected units can be dependent, as introduced by Fritz et al. (2025) <doi:10.1080/01621459.2025.2565851>. 'igml' extends GLMs for independent responses to dependent responses and can be used for studying spillover in connected populations and other network-mediated phenomena.
