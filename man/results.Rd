\usage{
results(size_coef, size_coef_popularity, file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{size_coef}{(integer) The number of non-popularity coefficients the object
should be initialized to accommodate.}

\item{size_coef_popularity}{(integer) The number of popularity coefficients
the object should be initialized to accommodate.}

\item{file}{(character or NULL) Optional file path to load a previously saved
`results` object. If provided, the object will be initialized by loading
from this file.}
}
\value{
An object of class `results` (and `R6`), initialized with empty or

\description{

store various outputs from `iglm` model estimation and simulation. Users
typically do not need to call this constructor directly; it is used internally
by the `iglm_object`.
